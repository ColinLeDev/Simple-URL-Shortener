# simple-shortener by Azlux

Simple shortener working with MySQL or SQLite database in PHP.
The goal is to create a simple and KISS shortener without dependencies.
The user can add comments for the link to find it faster into its history.


Nice shortcut added. The shortcut will create a new short url of your current page when you click on it.
Writed to work into subfolder. (don't need to be at the root)


## Installation :
- clone this project
- Copy `inc/config.example.php` to `inc/config.php`
- Set you config file
- Call `installation.php` to setup the database
- delete `installation.php`
- Create a user, the first one will be an admin (allow you to see no connected shorted links)
